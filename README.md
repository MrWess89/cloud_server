# Cloud Server Project

This project is a progressive cloud/server setup designed to grow from a simple
filesystem structure into a full production-ready cloud application.

# Phase 1 – Initialization
The project starts with only essential directories to keep things simple and secure.

# Current Structure
- logs/    → stores application and system logs
- public/  → public-facing files and services
- private/ → internal configs, secrets, and restricted files

# Additional folders (app, docker, ci-cd, k8s, scripts) will be introduced gradually
as the project moves into production stages.

# Goal
To practice real-world DevOps workflows including:
- Linux fundamentals
- Git & GitHub
- CI/CD pipelines
- Docker & Kubernetes
- Secure cloud deployment
